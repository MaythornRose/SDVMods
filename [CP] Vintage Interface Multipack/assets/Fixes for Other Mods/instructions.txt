To use these with other mods:

1. Pick out the image that matches the theme you are using.
2. Remove the "_brown" or "_white" from the name.
3. Copy and paste the image into the mod folder of the mod you wish to alter and allow it to overwrite.

Remember that if you update any of the mods listed here that the image will be replaced and you will have to change it again.
